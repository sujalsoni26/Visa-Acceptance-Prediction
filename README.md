# Visa-Acceptance-Prediction
Millions of individuals apply for visas each year for various purposes like- work, study, travel and some for the purpose of immigration. However, the visa approval process is often challenging as it is very complex, lengthy and time consuming, this leads to frequent rejections. By developing a model for predicting visa approval outcomes, applicants can gain valuable insights into the data and the chances for the success of their applications, helping them minimize uncertainty and better prepare for the future by identifying the possible gaps in their applications.
